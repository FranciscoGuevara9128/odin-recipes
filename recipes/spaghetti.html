    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti is my 4-year-olds absolute favorite thing to eat. 
        So I make it all the time.  This has become my go-to recipe. 
        The sauce is loaded with tons of meaty flavor and there is enough 
        of it to generously coat a full pound of spaghetti pasta.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best spaghetti recipe starts with an amazing homemade spaghetti sauce. 
        This one has ground beef, sausage, and the perfect blend of seasonings.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. 80% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 medium onion -chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves -minced</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 (6 oz.) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz.) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz.) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>11 lb. dried spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the meat sauce. Add the beef and sausage to a large skillet over medium-high heat, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the onion and garlic. Cook until meat is browned, about 6-8 minutes. Drain the fat from the meat.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, basil, and black pepper to the skillet with the cooked meat. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste. Stir until no large clumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir until well combined. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the sauce for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the minced parsley.</li>
        <li>As the sauce is simmering, cook the pasta al dente according to its package directions. Drain the pasta well, and return it to the large pot used for boiling.</li>
        <li>Pour the meat sauce over the pasta. Stir well. Add the parmesan cheese to the pasta. Stir well. Let the spaghetti rest in the meat sauce for 5 minutes before serving to let the pasta absorb some of the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
